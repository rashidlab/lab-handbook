## Action Items Best Practices

Effective action items follow the **SMART** criteria:

### Writing Good Action Items

| Element | Bad Example | Good Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Specific** | "Work on analysis" | "Run sensitivity analysis for Table 2 scenarios" |
| **Measurable** | "Make progress" | "Complete first draft of Methods section" |
| **Assignable** | "Someone should..." | "@jsmith will..." |
| **Realistic** | "Finish entire paper" | "Write Results section (3 pages)" |
| **Time-bound** | "Soon" | "By Friday Feb 14" |

### Action Item Format

Each action item should include:

```markdown
- [ ] **[Action verb] [specific task]** - @assignee - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Submit IRB amendment for protocol change** - @jsmith - Due: 2026-02-10
- [ ] **Review and comment on manuscript draft** - @mjones - Due: 2026-02-12
- [ ] **Run power analysis with updated parameters** - @klee - Due: 2026-02-14
```

### Tracking Status

Update action items with status indicators:

| Status | Markdown | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Not started | `- [ ]` | Work not begun |
| In progress | `- [ ] :hourglass:` | Actively working |
| Blocked | `- [ ] :red_circle:` | Waiting on something |
| Complete | `- [x]` | Done |

### Weekly Review

At each meeting:

1. **Review last week's action items** (first 5 minutes)
2. **Update statuses** in the Discussion thread
3. **Discuss blockers** and reassign if needed
4. **Carry forward** incomplete items with new due dates

---

## Presentation Guidelines

### Research Update Presentations

When presenting at lab meeting:

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Length** | 10-15 minutes + 5 min questions |
| **Slides** | Optional; screen share code/results is fine |
| **Focus** | What you did, what you found, where you're stuck |
| **Feedback** | Be specific about what feedback you want |

### Presentation Structure

1. **Context** (1-2 min): Remind us of the project goals
2. **Progress** (5-7 min): What you've done since last update
3. **Results** (3-5 min): Key findings, figures, tables
4. **Challenges** (2-3 min): Where you're stuck or need input
5. **Next steps** (1 min): What you plan to do next
6. **Questions** (5 min): Specific questions for the group

### Giving Feedback

When providing feedback:

- **Be constructive**: Suggest alternatives, not just problems
- **Be specific**: Point to exact issues
- **Prioritize**: Distinguish major concerns from minor suggestions
- **Be supportive**: Research is hard; acknowledge good work
