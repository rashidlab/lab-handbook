## Phase 1: Create the Agenda (Tuesday)

**Goal:** Create a GitHub Discussion thread where everyone can add agenda items.

### Step 1.1: Navigate to Discussions

1. Go to [github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook)
2. Click the **Discussions** tab at the top
3. Click **New discussion** (green button)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Code   Issues   Pull requests   Discussions   ...      │
│                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^            │
│                                  Click here             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1.2: Select Category

1. Select **Lab Meetings** category
2. This ensures the discussion appears in the right place

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select a category                                       │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ ○ Announcements                                     │ │
│ │ ○ General                                           │ │
│ │ ● Lab Meetings  ← Select this                       │ │
│ │ ○ Journal Club                                      │ │
│ │ ○ Q&A                                               │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1.3: Create the Thread

1. **Title:** `Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD` (use this Thursday's date)
   - Example: `Lab Meeting - 2026-02-07`

2. **Body:** Copy the [Agenda Template](meeting-templates.qmd#agenda-template) and paste it

3. **Fill in the template:**
   - Replace `[DATE]` with the meeting date
   - Replace `@[github-username]` with your GitHub username
   - Add the confirmed presenter(s) to the Research Updates section
   - Add the Teams meeting link or room number

4. Click **Start discussion**

### Step 1.4: Post a Reminder in Teams

Post in the `#general` Teams channel:

```
📋 Lab meeting agenda is up for Thursday [DATE]!

Please add your items by Wednesday 5pm:
https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/[DISCUSSION_NUMBER]

This week:
- Lead: @[your name]
- Presenter: @[presenter name]
```

---

## Phase 2: Monitor Contributions (Wednesday)

**Goal:** Ensure everyone has a chance to add items and send a final reminder.

### Step 2.1: Check the Thread

1. Go to your Discussion thread
2. See if people have replied with agenda items
3. Incorporate their items into the main agenda if helpful

### Step 2.2: Send Final Reminder

If few items have been added, post in Teams:

```
⏰ Reminder: Add your lab meeting items by 5pm today!

Link: https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/[NUMBER]

Topics so far:
- [List current items]

Anything to add? Drop it in the thread!
```

### Step 2.3: Confirm with Presenter(s)

Direct message or tag the presenter(s):
- Confirm they're prepared
- Ask how much time they need
- Ask if they need anything (screen share, etc.)

---

## Phase 3: Facilitate the Meeting (Thursday)

**Goal:** Run an efficient meeting and capture key information.

### Step 3.1: Before the Meeting (5 min prior)

1. Open the Discussion thread on your screen
2. Have a note-taking document ready (or note directly in the thread)
3. Review the agenda one more time

### Step 3.2: Start the Meeting

1. **Welcome** (1 min)
   - "Welcome to lab meeting. I'm [name], leading today."

2. **Check attendees** (1 min)
   - Note who's present (you'll update the thread later)

3. **Review last week's action items** (5 min)
   - Open last week's Discussion thread
   - Go through each action item: "Alice, did you complete X?"
   - Note status: done, in progress, blocked, carried forward

### Step 3.3: Run Through Agenda

For each agenda item:

1. **Introduce the item** and the person presenting
2. **Keep time** - give a 2-minute warning
3. **Capture key points:**
   - Decisions made
   - Questions raised
   - Action items that come up (who, what, when)
4. **Move on** when time is up

::: {.callout-note}
## Pro Tip: Action Items
When someone says "I'll do X" or "We should Y," immediately ask:
- "By when?"
- "Who's responsible?"

Write it down immediately!
:::

### Step 3.4: Wrap Up (5 min before end)

1. **Summarize decisions** made today
2. **Read back action items** - confirm assignees and due dates
3. **Confirm next week's lead and presenter**
4. **Ask for any final items** for parking lot

---

## Phase 4: Post Meeting Notes (Thursday EOD)

**Goal:** Document what happened so anyone can reference it later.

### Step 4.1: Update the Discussion Thread

1. Go to your Discussion thread
2. Click **Edit** on your original post (or add a reply)
3. Add the Meeting Notes section (see [Meeting Notes Template](meeting-templates.qmd#meeting-notes-template))

**Include:**

| Section | What to Write |
|---------|---------------|
| **Attendees** | Check off who was present |
| **Decisions Made** | Any decisions the group agreed on |
| **Discussion Summary** | Key points from each topic |
| **Action Items** | Task, assignee, due date |
| **Parking Lot** | Items deferred to later |
| **Next Meeting** | Date, lead, presenter |

### Step 4.2: @mention Action Item Owners

For each action item, use `@username` to notify the assignee:

```markdown
### Action Items

| Task | Assignee | Due Date | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Run sensitivity analysis | @jsmith | 2026-02-14 | [ ] |
| Review manuscript draft | @bjones | 2026-02-12 | [ ] |
```

When you save, GitHub sends notifications to @jsmith and @bjones.

### Step 4.3: Commit Notes to Repository

The Discussion thread is great, but we also keep a permanent record in the repo.

```bash
# 1. Go to the lab-handbook directory
cd ~/lab-handbook  # or wherever you cloned it

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create the notes file
cp meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md

# 4. Edit the file with your notes
# (Copy from Discussion thread, paste into file)

# 5. Commit and push
git add meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
git commit -m "notes: lab meeting 2026-02-07"
git push origin main
```

**Can't use git?** You can also:
1. Go to [meeting-notes/2026/](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/tree/main/meeting-notes/2026) on GitHub
2. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
3. Name it `2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md`
4. Paste your notes
5. Click **Commit new file**

---

## Phase 5: Follow Up (Next Week)

### Step 5.1: Hand Off to Next Lead

Post in the Discussion thread or Teams:

```
@[next-lead] - You're leading next week's meeting!

Reminder: Create the agenda thread by Tuesday 5pm.
Here's the guide: https://rashidlab.github.io/lab-handbook/policies/meeting-leader-guide.html

### Step 5.2: Monday Action Item Check
