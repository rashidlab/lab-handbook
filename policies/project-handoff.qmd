title: "Project Handoff"
subtitle: "Transferring projects between lab members"
---

## Overview

Project handoffs occur when:

- A student graduates or leaves the lab
- Responsibilities shift between team members
- A project enters a new phase requiring different expertise
- Someone joins an ongoing project

A good handoff ensures continuity and prevents loss of institutional knowledge.

## Handoff Timeline

Start the handoff process **at least 4 weeks** before departure:

| Week | Activities |
|------|------------|
| **4 weeks out** | Identify successor, schedule knowledge transfer sessions |
| **3 weeks out** | Document current state, update README and CLAUDE.md |
| **2 weeks out** | Pair programming sessions, code walkthrough |
| **1 week out** | Successor takes lead with outgoing member as backup |
| **After** | 2-week grace period for questions via email/Teams |

## Documentation Checklist

Before handoff, ensure these are complete and current:

### Repository Documentation

- [ ] **README.md** - Updated with:
  - Project overview and goals
  - Directory structure
  - Setup instructions that work
  - How to run the main analyses
  - Known issues and quirks

- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** - Documents:
  - Key commands
  - Architecture decisions
  - Common workflows
  - Project-specific conventions

### Code Quality

- [ ] All code runs without errors from a fresh clone
- [ ] No hardcoded paths specific to your machine
- [ ] Dependencies documented (DESCRIPTION, requirements.txt)
- [ ] Seeds set for reproducibility
- [ ] Comments explain *why*, not just *what*

### Data & Results

- [ ] Data sources documented
- [ ] Raw data preserved, never modified
- [ ] Processed data regenerable from scripts
- [ ] Results match what's in manuscript/reports
- [ ] Symlinks or paths documented for Longleaf storage

### Project State

- [ ] **Open issues** triaged with current status
- [ ] **In-progress work** documented (what's done, what remains)
- [ ] **Blockers** identified (awaiting data, reviewer feedback, etc.)
- [ ] **Timeline** for paper submission or next milestones

## Knowledge Transfer Sessions

Schedule 2-3 sessions covering:

### Session 1: Architecture Overview (1-2 hours)

Walk through:

- Why the project exists
- What questions it answers
- High-level approach and methods
- Directory structure and key files
- Where data lives and how it flows

### Session 2: Code Walkthrough (2-3 hours)

Cover:

- Main analysis scripts
- Key functions and their purpose
- The `_targets.R` pipeline (if applicable)
- How to run things end-to-end
- Common debugging scenarios

### Session 3: Hands-On (1-2 hours)

Let the successor:

- Set up the project from scratch
- Run the full analysis
- Make a small change
- Troubleshoot issues with guidance

## Handoff Document Template

Create a `HANDOFF.md` in the repository:

```markdown
# Project Handoff: [Project Name]

## Outgoing: [Name]
## Incoming: [Name]
## Date: [Date]

---

## Project Status

**Phase:** [Data collection / Analysis / Writing / Revision]

**Next milestone:** [What and when]

**Blocking issues:**
- [Issue or none]

---

## Key Contacts

| Role | Person | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| PI | Dr. Rashid | Biweekly check-ins |
| Collaborator | [Name] | Provides clinical data |
| Co-author | [Name] | Methods expert |

---

## Critical Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_targets.R` | Main analysis pipeline |
| `R/core_analysis.R` | Primary analysis functions |
| `manuscript/paper.qmd` | Current draft |
| `config/globals.yml` | Project configuration |

---

## Current Workflows

### To run the main analysis:
```bash
# Full run
make all

# Quick test
make quick
```

### To render the manuscript:
```bash
quarto render manuscript/paper.qmd
```

### To check results:
```r
targets::tar_read(final_results)
```

## Known Issues

1. **Issue**: [Description]
   **Workaround**: [How to deal with it]

2. **Issue**: [Description]
   **Workaround**: [How to deal with it]

---

## Unfinished Work

- [ ] Complete sensitivity analysis (started in `R/sensitivity.R`)
- [ ] Address reviewer comment #3 (see Issues)
- [ ] Final proofreading of manuscript

---

## Questions?

Contact [outgoing person] at [email] until [date].
After that: [alternative contact or "lab meeting"].
```

## After Handoff

### For the outgoing member:

1. Archive personal notes that might be useful
2. Update your contributions in README acknowledgments
3. Remain available for questions during grace period
4. Remove yourself from repository notifications (if leaving lab)

### For the incoming member:

1. Attempt full reproduction without help first
2. Document any unclear steps you discover
3. Update documentation for the next person
4. Ask questions early—don't struggle alone

### For the lab:

1. Add handoff to lab meeting agenda
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update this guide if process could improve

## Special Cases

### Incomplete Projects

If a project can't be finished before departure:

1. Document exactly where you stopped
2. Outline what remains (be specific)
3. Identify any time-sensitive elements
4. Archive code in a working state

### Sensitive Data Projects

Extra steps for projects with PHI or restricted data:

1. Verify successor has required training and access
2. Document all data sources and IRB protocols
3. Transfer data access permissions properly
4. Update data use agreements if needed

### Publications in Progress

If paper is under review or revision:

1. Clarify who handles revisions
2. Transfer corresponding author duties if needed
3. Document submission history and reviewer feedback
4. Ensure co-authors are informed of transition

## Questions?

Discuss handoffs in 1:1 meetings with Dr. Rashid or bring questions to lab meeting.
