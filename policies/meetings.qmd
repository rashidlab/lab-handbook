## Overview

Lab meetings are essential for sharing progress, getting feedback, and staying aligned as a team. We use **GitHub Discussions** in the [lab-handbook repository](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions) to organize meeting agendas, capture notes, and track action items.

This approach provides:

- **Transparency**: Everyone can see what's coming up and what was discussed
- **Searchable history**: Easy to find past decisions and context
- **Accountability**: Action items are tracked with assignees and due dates
- **Asynchronous input**: Add agenda items anytime before the meeting

## Meeting Types

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meeting** | Weekly (Thursdays 9:30am) | 90 min | Research presentations, paper discussions |
| **1:1 with Dr. Rashid** | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Individual progress, mentorship |
| **Working Groups** | As needed | 30-60 min | Project-specific collaboration |

## Virtual & Hybrid Participation

When attending remotely or in hybrid format:

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| **Joining remotely** | Use Teams link in calendar invite; mute when not speaking |
| **Leading remotely** | Share screen with Discussion thread; designate in-person note backup |
| **Hybrid meeting** | In-room laptop displays remote participants; one person monitors chat |

**Teams link:** Posted in each meeting's Discussion thread by the lead.

**Screen sharing:** Presenter shares their screen; others keep video on if bandwidth allows.

**Remote participation tips:**

- Join 2-3 minutes early to test audio/video
- Use "raise hand" feature for questions
- Keep camera on when speaking if possible

## GitHub Discussions Workflow

### Meeting Discussion Categories

We use the following Discussion categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meetings** | Weekly lab meeting threads |
| **Announcements** | Lab-wide announcements |
| **Q&A** | Technical questions and answers |

### Weekly Lab Meeting Thread

Each lab meeting gets its own Discussion thread, created by that week's **meeting lead**. The thread serves as the single source of truth for agenda, notes, and action items.

**Thread title format:** `Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD`

**Example:** `Lab Meeting - 2026-02-07`
