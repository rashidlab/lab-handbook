## Overview

Lab meetings are essential for sharing progress, getting feedback, and staying aligned as a team. We use **GitHub Discussions** in the [lab-handbook repository](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions) to organize meeting agendas, capture notes, and track action items.

This approach provides:

- **Transparency**: Everyone can see what's coming up and what was discussed
- **Searchable history**: Easy to find past decisions and context
- **Accountability**: Action items are tracked with assignees and due dates
- **Asynchronous input**: Add agenda items anytime before the meeting

## Meeting Types

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meeting** | Weekly (Fridays 2pm) | 60 min | Research presentations, paper discussions |
| **1:1 with Dr. Rashid** | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Individual progress, mentorship |
| **Working Groups** | As needed | 30-60 min | Project-specific collaboration |
| **Journal Club** | Monthly | 45 min | Discuss recent papers in the field |

## GitHub Discussions Workflow

### Meeting Discussion Categories

We use the following Discussion categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meetings** | Weekly lab meeting threads |
| **Journal Club** | Paper discussion threads |
| **Announcements** | Lab-wide announcements |
| **Q&A** | Technical questions and answers |

### Weekly Lab Meeting Thread

Each lab meeting gets its own Discussion thread, created by that week's **meeting lead**. The thread serves as the single source of truth for agenda, notes, and action items.

**Thread title format:** `Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD`

**Example:** `Lab Meeting - 2026-02-07`

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Meeting Lead (Rotates Weekly)

The meeting lead is responsible for:

1. **Create the Discussion thread** by Wednesday 5pm
2. **Post the agenda template** (see below)
3. **Remind team members** to add their items by Thursday 5pm
4. **Facilitate the meeting** and keep time
5. **Take notes** during the meeting (or designate a note-taker)
6. **Update the Discussion thread** with notes and action items after the meeting
7. **Commit meeting notes** to the repository (see [Committing Meeting Notes](#committing-meeting-notes))

### All Lab Members

Every lab member should:

1. **Add agenda items** by Thursday 5pm if you have updates
2. **Review the agenda** before the meeting
3. **Complete action items** by their due dates
4. **Update action item status** in the Discussion thread

---

## Agenda Template

The meeting lead should copy this template when creating the weekly Discussion thread:

```markdown
## Lab Meeting - [DATE]

**Lead:** @[github-username]
**Time:** Friday [DATE] 2:00-3:00 PM
**Location:** [Room / Teams Link]

---

To add an agenda item, reply to the Discussion thread with:

```markdown
### [Your Name] - Agenda Item

**Topic:** [Brief title]
**Time needed:** [5/10/15 min]
**Type:** [Update / Discussion / Decision needed / FYI]

```

---

## Committing Meeting Notes {#committing-meeting-notes}

In addition to updating the GitHub Discussion thread, the meeting lead **must commit** a permanent record of the meeting notes to the repository. This ensures:

- **Permanence**: Notes are version-controlled and can't be accidentally deleted
- **Offline access**: Notes available without internet
- **Searchability**: Full-text search across all historical notes
- **Backup**: Discussion threads are supplementary; committed notes are the record of truth

### File Structure

Meeting notes are stored in `meeting-notes/` organized by year:

```
meeting-notes/
├── 2026/
│   ├── 2026-01-31-lab-meeting.md
│   ├── 2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
│   └── 2026-02-07-journal-club.md
└── README.md
```

### Committing Notes (Meeting Lead)

After updating the Discussion thread, commit the notes:

```bash
# 1. Create the notes file from template
cp meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md

# 2. Edit with your notes (copy from Discussion thread)
# Use your preferred editor

# 3. Commit and push
git add meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
git commit -m "notes: lab meeting 2026-02-07"
git push origin main
```

### Meeting Notes File Template

Save this as `meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
# Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD

**Lead:** @username
**Attendees:** @person1, @person2, @person3

## Agenda

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

## Action Items Best Practices

Effective action items follow the **SMART** criteria:

### Writing Good Action Items

| Element | Bad Example | Good Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Specific** | "Work on analysis" | "Run sensitivity analysis for Table 2 scenarios" |
| **Measurable** | "Make progress" | "Complete first draft of Methods section" |
| **Assignable** | "Someone should..." | "@jsmith will..." |
| **Realistic** | "Finish entire paper" | "Write Results section (3 pages)" |
| **Time-bound** | "Soon" | "By Friday Feb 14" |

### Action Item Format

Each action item should include:

```markdown
- [ ] **[Action verb] [specific task]** - @assignee - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Submit IRB amendment for protocol change** - @jsmith - Due: 2026-02-10
- [ ] **Review and comment on manuscript draft** - @mjones - Due: 2026-02-12
- [ ] **Run power analysis with updated parameters** - @klee - Due: 2026-02-14
```

### Tracking Status

Update action items with status indicators:

| Status | Markdown | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Not started | `- [ ]` | Work not begun |
| In progress | `- [ ] :hourglass:` | Actively working |
| Blocked | `- [ ] :red_circle:` | Waiting on something |
| Complete | `- [x]` | Done |

### Weekly Review

At each meeting:

1. **Review last week's action items** (first 5 minutes)
2. **Update statuses** in the Discussion thread
3. **Discuss blockers** and reassign if needed
4. **Carry forward** incomplete items with new due dates

---

## Presentation Guidelines

### Research Update Presentations

When presenting at lab meeting:

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Length** | 10-15 minutes + 5 min questions |
| **Slides** | Optional; screen share code/results is fine |
| **Focus** | What you did, what you found, where you're stuck |
| **Feedback** | Be specific about what feedback you want |

### Presentation Structure

1. **Context** (1-2 min): Remind us of the project goals
2. **Progress** (5-7 min): What you've done since last update
3. **Results** (3-5 min): Key findings, figures, tables
4. **Challenges** (2-3 min): Where you're stuck or need input
5. **Next steps** (1 min): What you plan to do next
6. **Questions** (5 min): Specific questions for the group

### Giving Feedback

When providing feedback:

- **Be constructive**: Suggest alternatives, not just problems
- **Be specific**: Point to exact issues
- **Prioritize**: Distinguish major concerns from minor suggestions
- **Be supportive**: Research is hard; acknowledge good work

---

## Journal Club Format

Monthly journal club follows a different format:

### Paper Selection

- **Nominate papers** in the `#papers` Teams channel
- **Vote** by emoji reactions
- **Lead** assigned 2 weeks before discussion

### Discussion Thread Template

```markdown
## Journal Club - [DATE]

**Paper:** [Full citation]
**DOI:** [link]
**Lead:** @[username]

### Pre-Reading Questions
Consider these while reading:
1. What is the main contribution?
2. What are the key assumptions?
3. How does this relate to our work?

### Discussion Points
(Add your thoughts and questions below)

### Summary
(Lead adds after discussion)
```

---

## Reminders and Notifications

Automated reminders are sent via Microsoft Teams:

| Reminder | When | Recipients |
|----------|------|------------|
| Create agenda thread | Wednesday 9am | Meeting lead |
| Add agenda items | Thursday 9am | All lab members |
| Meeting tomorrow | Thursday 5pm | All lab members |
| Action items due | Monday 9am | Assignees with items due that week |

See [GitHub Actions workflow](#github-actions-reminders) for implementation details.

## Tips for Effective Meetings

Based on research from [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/meeting-agenda-examples/), [Fellow](https://fellow.app/blog/meetings/how-to-manage-meeting-tasks-and-action-items/), and [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/blog/action-items-with-meeting-notes-template/):

1. **Send agenda 24+ hours ahead** - Gives time to prepare
2. **Start with action item review** - Creates accountability
3. **Assign a timekeeper** - Keeps discussions focused
4. **End 5 minutes early** - Time for wrap-up and action items
5. **Post notes same day** - While memory is fresh
6. **Use checkboxes** - Makes completion visible
7. **@mention assignees** - Sends GitHub notifications
8. **Review parking lot monthly** - Don't let items languish
