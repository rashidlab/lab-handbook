## Overview

Lab meetings are essential for sharing progress, getting feedback, and staying aligned as a team. We use **GitHub Discussions** in the [lab-handbook repository](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions) to organize meeting agendas, capture notes, and track action items.

This approach provides:

- **Transparency**: Everyone can see what's coming up and what was discussed
- **Searchable history**: Easy to find past decisions and context
- **Accountability**: Action items are tracked with assignees and due dates
- **Asynchronous input**: Add agenda items anytime before the meeting

## Meeting Types

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meeting** | Weekly (Thursdays 9:30am) | 90 min | Research presentations, paper discussions |
| **1:1 with Dr. Rashid** | Bi-weekly | 30 min | Individual progress, mentorship |
| **Working Groups** | As needed | 30-60 min | Project-specific collaboration |

## GitHub Discussions Workflow

### Meeting Discussion Categories

We use the following Discussion categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Lab Meetings** | Weekly lab meeting threads |
| **Announcements** | Lab-wide announcements |
| **Q&A** | Technical questions and answers |

### Weekly Lab Meeting Thread

Each lab meeting gets its own Discussion thread, created by that week's **meeting lead**. The thread serves as the single source of truth for agenda, notes, and action items.

**Thread title format:** `Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD`

**Example:** `Lab Meeting - 2026-02-07`

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Meeting Lead (Rotates Weekly)

The meeting lead is responsible for:

1. **Create the Discussion thread** by Tuesday 5pm
2. **Post the agenda template** (see below)
3. **Remind team members** to add their items by Tuesday 5pm
4. **Facilitate the meeting** and keep time
5. **Take notes** during the meeting (or designate a note-taker)
6. **Update the Discussion thread** with notes and action items after the meeting
7. **Commit meeting notes** to the repository (see [Committing Meeting Notes](#committing-meeting-notes))

### All Lab Members

Every lab member should:

1. **Add agenda items** by Tuesday 5pm if you have updates
2. **Review the agenda** before the meeting
3. **Complete action items** by their due dates
4. **Update action item status** in the Discussion thread

---

## Discussion Leader Walkthrough {#leader-walkthrough}

This is a complete step-by-step guide for the meeting lead. Follow this checklist each week you're the lead.

::: {.callout-tip}
## First Time Leading?
Read [GitHub Fundamentals](../onboarding/github-fundamentals.qmd) first to understand how Discussions, Issues, and PRs work.
:::

### Phase 1: Create the Agenda (Tuesday)

**Goal:** Create a GitHub Discussion thread where everyone can add agenda items.

#### Step 1.1: Navigate to Discussions

1. Go to [github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook)
2. Click the **Discussions** tab at the top
3. Click **New discussion** (green button)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Code   Issues   Pull requests   Discussions   ...      │
│                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^            │
│                                  Click here             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 1.2: Select Category

1. Select **Lab Meetings** category
2. This ensures the discussion appears in the right place

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select a category                                       │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ ○ Announcements                                     │ │
│ │ ○ General                                           │ │
│ │ ● Lab Meetings  ← Select this                       │ │
│ │ ○ Journal Club                                      │ │
│ │ ○ Q&A                                               │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 1.3: Create the Thread

1. **Title:** `Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD` (use this Thursday's date)
   - Example: `Lab Meeting - 2026-02-07`

2. **Body:** Copy the [Agenda Template](#agenda-template) below and paste it

3. **Fill in the template:**
   - Replace `[DATE]` with the meeting date
   - Replace `@[github-username]` with your GitHub username
   - Add the confirmed presenter(s) to the Research Updates section
   - Add the Teams meeting link or room number

4. Click **Start discussion**

#### Step 1.4: Post a Reminder in Teams

Post in the `#general` Teams channel:

```
📋 Lab meeting agenda is up for Thursday [DATE]!

Please add your items by Wednesday 5pm:
https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/[DISCUSSION_NUMBER]

This week:
- Lead: @[your name]
- Presenter: @[presenter name]
```

### Phase 2: Monitor Contributions (Wednesday)

**Goal:** Ensure everyone has a chance to add items and send a final reminder.

#### Step 2.1: Check the Thread

1. Go to your Discussion thread
2. See if people have replied with agenda items
3. Incorporate their items into the main agenda if helpful

#### Step 2.2: Send Final Reminder

If few items have been added, post in Teams:

```
⏰ Reminder: Add your lab meeting items by 5pm today!

Link: https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/[NUMBER]

Topics so far:
- [List current items]

Anything to add? Drop it in the thread!
```

#### Step 2.3: Confirm with Presenter(s)

Direct message or tag the presenter(s):
- Confirm they're prepared
- Ask how much time they need
- Ask if they need anything (screen share, etc.)

### Phase 3: Facilitate the Meeting (Thursday)

**Goal:** Run an efficient meeting and capture key information.

#### Step 3.1: Before the Meeting (5 min prior)

1. Open the Discussion thread on your screen
2. Have a note-taking document ready (or note directly in the thread)
3. Review the agenda one more time

#### Step 3.2: Start the Meeting

1. **Welcome** (1 min)
   - "Welcome to lab meeting. I'm [name], leading today."

2. **Check attendees** (1 min)
   - Note who's present (you'll update the thread later)

3. **Review last week's action items** (5 min)
   - Open last week's Discussion thread
   - Go through each action item: "Alice, did you complete X?"
   - Note status: done, in progress, blocked, carried forward

#### Step 3.3: Run Through Agenda

For each agenda item:

1. **Introduce the item** and the person presenting
2. **Keep time** - give a 2-minute warning
3. **Capture key points:**
   - Decisions made
   - Questions raised
   - Action items that come up (who, what, when)
4. **Move on** when time is up

::: {.callout-note}
## Pro Tip: Action Items
When someone says "I'll do X" or "We should Y," immediately ask:
- "By when?"
- "Who's responsible?"

Write it down immediately!
:::

#### Step 3.4: Wrap Up (5 min before end)

1. **Summarize decisions** made today
2. **Read back action items** - confirm assignees and due dates
3. **Confirm next week's lead and presenter**
4. **Ask for any final items** for parking lot

### Phase 4: Post Meeting Notes (Thursday EOD)

**Goal:** Document what happened so anyone can reference it later.

#### Step 4.1: Update the Discussion Thread

1. Go to your Discussion thread
2. Click **Edit** on your original post (or add a reply)
3. Add the Meeting Notes section (see [template below](#meeting-notes-template))

**Include:**

| Section | What to Write |
|---------|---------------|
| **Attendees** | Check off who was present |
| **Decisions Made** | Any decisions the group agreed on |
| **Discussion Summary** | Key points from each topic |
| **Action Items** | Task, assignee, due date |
| **Parking Lot** | Items deferred to later |
| **Next Meeting** | Date, lead, presenter |

#### Step 4.2: @mention Action Item Owners

For each action item, use `@username` to notify the assignee:

```markdown
### Action Items

| Task | Assignee | Due Date | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Run sensitivity analysis | @jsmith | 2026-02-14 | [ ] |
| Review manuscript draft | @bjones | 2026-02-12 | [ ] |
```

When you save, GitHub sends notifications to @jsmith and @bjones.

#### Step 4.3: Commit Notes to Repository

The Discussion thread is great, but we also keep a permanent record in the repo.

```bash
# 1. Go to the lab-handbook directory
cd ~/lab-handbook  # or wherever you cloned it

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Create the notes file
cp meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md

# 4. Edit the file with your notes
# (Copy from Discussion thread, paste into file)

# 5. Commit and push
git add meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
git commit -m "notes: lab meeting 2026-02-07"
git push origin main
```

**Can't use git?** You can also:
1. Go to [meeting-notes/2026/](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/tree/main/meeting-notes/2026) on GitHub
2. Click **Add file** → **Create new file**
3. Name it `2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md`
4. Paste your notes
5. Click **Commit new file**

### Phase 5: Follow Up (Next Week)

#### Step 5.1: Hand Off to Next Lead

Post in the Discussion thread or Teams:

```
@[next-lead] - You're leading next week's meeting!

Reminder: Create the agenda thread by Tuesday 5pm.
Here's the template: [link to meetings guide]
```

#### Step 5.2: Monday Action Item Check

Check in on action items mid-week:
- Review the thread for status updates
- Ping people who haven't updated their items
- Offer help if anyone is stuck

---

## Committing Meeting Notes {#committing-meeting-notes}

In addition to updating the GitHub Discussion thread, the meeting lead **must commit** a permanent record of the meeting notes to the repository. This ensures:

- **Permanence**: Notes are version-controlled and can't be accidentally deleted
- **Offline access**: Notes available without internet
- **Searchability**: Full-text search across all historical notes
- **Backup**: Discussion threads are supplementary; committed notes are the record of truth

### File Structure

Meeting notes are stored in `meeting-notes/` organized by year:

```
meeting-notes/
├── 2026/
│   ├── 2026-01-31-lab-meeting.md
│   └── 2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
└── README.md
```

### Committing Notes (Meeting Lead)

After updating the Discussion thread, commit the notes:

```bash
# 1. Create the notes file from template
cp meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md

# 2. Edit with your notes (copy from Discussion thread)
# Use your preferred editor

# 3. Commit and push
git add meeting-notes/2026/2026-02-07-lab-meeting.md
git commit -m "notes: lab meeting 2026-02-07"
git push origin main
```

### Meeting Notes File Template

Save this as `meeting-notes/TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
# Lab Meeting - YYYY-MM-DD

**Lead:** @username
**Attendees:** @person1, @person2, @person3

## Agenda

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

## Decisions Made

- Decision 1

- **Lead:** @username
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Quick Commit
You can copy-paste directly from the GitHub Discussion into the markdown file. The format is identical.

## Action Items Best Practices

Effective action items follow the **SMART** criteria:

### Writing Good Action Items

| Element | Bad Example | Good Example |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Specific** | "Work on analysis" | "Run sensitivity analysis for Table 2 scenarios" |
| **Measurable** | "Make progress" | "Complete first draft of Methods section" |
| **Assignable** | "Someone should..." | "@jsmith will..." |
| **Realistic** | "Finish entire paper" | "Write Results section (3 pages)" |
| **Time-bound** | "Soon" | "By Friday Feb 14" |

### Action Item Format

Each action item should include:

```markdown
- [ ] **[Action verb] [specific task]** - @assignee - Due: YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Examples:**
```markdown
- [ ] **Submit IRB amendment for protocol change** - @jsmith - Due: 2026-02-10
- [ ] **Review and comment on manuscript draft** - @mjones - Due: 2026-02-12
- [ ] **Run power analysis with updated parameters** - @klee - Due: 2026-02-14
```

### Tracking Status

Update action items with status indicators:

| Status | Markdown | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Not started | `- [ ]` | Work not begun |
| In progress | `- [ ] :hourglass:` | Actively working |
| Blocked | `- [ ] :red_circle:` | Waiting on something |
| Complete | `- [x]` | Done |

### Weekly Review

At each meeting:

1. **Review last week's action items** (first 5 minutes)
2. **Update statuses** in the Discussion thread
3. **Discuss blockers** and reassign if needed
4. **Carry forward** incomplete items with new due dates

---

## Presentation Guidelines

### Research Update Presentations

When presenting at lab meeting:

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Length** | 10-15 minutes + 5 min questions |
| **Slides** | Optional; screen share code/results is fine |
| **Focus** | What you did, what you found, where you're stuck |
| **Feedback** | Be specific about what feedback you want |

### Presentation Structure

1. **Context** (1-2 min): Remind us of the project goals
2. **Progress** (5-7 min): What you've done since last update
3. **Results** (3-5 min): Key findings, figures, tables
4. **Challenges** (2-3 min): Where you're stuck or need input
5. **Next steps** (1 min): What you plan to do next
6. **Questions** (5 min): Specific questions for the group

### Giving Feedback

When providing feedback:

- **Be constructive**: Suggest alternatives, not just problems
- **Be specific**: Point to exact issues
- **Prioritize**: Distinguish major concerns from minor suggestions
- **Be supportive**: Research is hard; acknowledge good work

---

## Reminders and Notifications

Automated reminders are sent via Microsoft Teams:

| Reminder | When | Recipients |
|----------|------|------------|
| Create agenda thread | Tuesday 9am | Meeting lead |
| Add agenda items | Wednesday 9am | All lab members |
| Meeting tomorrow | Wednesday 5pm | All lab members |
| Action items due | Monday 9am | Assignees with items due that week |

See [GitHub Actions workflow](#github-actions-reminders) for implementation details.

---

## GitHub Actions Reminders

The lab-handbook repository includes automated workflows that send reminders to Microsoft Teams.

### Setup Requirements

1. **Teams Incoming Webhook**: Created in your Teams channel
2. **GitHub Secret**: `MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URI` stored in repository secrets
3. **Meeting Schedule**: YAML file with rotation schedule

### Workflow Files

Located in `.github/workflows/`:

- `meeting-reminder-create.yml` - Reminds lead to create agenda (Wed)
- `meeting-reminder-contribute.yml` - Reminds all to add items (Thu)
- `action-item-reminder.yml` - Weekly action item reminders (Mon)

---

## Tips for Effective Meetings

Based on research from [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/meeting-agenda-examples/), [Fellow](https://fellow.app/blog/meetings/how-to-manage-meeting-tasks-and-action-items/), and [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/blog/action-items-with-meeting-notes-template/):

1. **Send agenda 24+ hours ahead** - Gives time to prepare
2. **Start with action item review** - Creates accountability
3. **Assign a timekeeper** - Keeps discussions focused
4. **End 5 minutes early** - Time for wrap-up and action items
5. **Post notes same day** - While memory is fresh
6. **Use checkboxes** - Makes completion visible
7. **@mention assignees** - Sends GitHub notifications
8. **Review parking lot monthly** - Don't let items languish
