## Communication

### Teams

Our primary communication tool. Key channels:

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#general` | Announcements, lab-wide discussions |
| `#computing` | Technical questions, Longleaf issues |
| `#papers` | Paper discussions, writing feedback |
| `#random` | Non-work chat |

**Response expectations:**

- Direct messages: Within 24 hours
- Channel mentions: Within 48 hours
- Urgent matters: Email or call

### Meetings

- **Lab meetings**: Weekly, attendance expected
- **1:1s with Dr. Rashid**: Bi-weekly or as scheduled
- **Working groups**: As needed for projects

## Detailed Meeting Guide
See the [Lab Meetings](meetings.qmd) page for comprehensive guidance on agendas, notes, action items, and the [Meeting Schedule](schedule.qmd) for the current rotation.

## Code and Data

### Version Control

All code must be version controlled with Git:

- Public repos on GitHub when possible
- Private repos for unpublished work
- No code in email attachments

### Data Management

::: {.callout-important}
## Never Push Data to Git
Data files—especially large ones—should **never** be committed to repositories. Use the lab project directory for data storage and symlinks for access.
:::

#### Storage Principles

| Data Type | Location | Git Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Raw data** | `/proj/rashidlab/<project>/data/raw/` | Never commit |
| **Processed data** | `/proj/rashidlab/<project>/data/processed/` | Never commit |
| **Small configs** | `config/` in repo | Commit |
| **Results** | `results/` in repo | Usually gitignore |

#### Why Not in Repos?

1. **Size limits**: GitHub has a 100MB file limit; data often exceeds this
2. **History bloat**: Binary files in Git history cause repo bloat
3. **Sensitive data**: PHI and identifiable data must never be in public repos
4. **Collaboration**: Large files slow down `git clone` for collaborators

#### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Store data in lab project directory
cp dataset.csv /proj/rashidlab/my-project/data/raw/

# 2. Create symlink from your repo (optional, for convenience)
cd my-project
ln -s /proj/rashidlab/my-project/data data

# 3. Ensure data/ is in .gitignore
echo "data/" >> .gitignore
```

#### After Publication

When the paper is accepted:

1. **Public data**: Upload to appropriate repository (GEO, Zenodo, figshare)
2. **Update README**: Add data download instructions with URLs
3. **Include setup script**: `scripts/download_data.sh` to automate retrieval

Example setup script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/download_data.sh - Download data after cloning repo

mkdir -p data/raw

# Download from GEO
wget -O data/raw/expression.csv "https://geo.example.com/GSE12345/data.csv"

# Download from Zenodo
wget -O data/raw/clinical.csv "https://zenodo.org/record/12345/files/clinical.csv"

echo "Data download complete. Run 'make all' to reproduce results."
```

#### Gitignore Template

Your `.gitignore` should include:
```
# Data (never commit)
data/
*.csv
*.tsv
*.xlsx
*.rds
*.RData

# Large outputs
results/
_targets/

# Sensitive
*.pem
*.key
.env
```

#### Key Principles

- **Raw data**: Never modify, always preserve original
- **Processed data**: Document all transformations in code
- **Sensitive data**: Follow IRB protocols strictly
- **Backups**: Lab project directory (`/proj/rashidlab/`) is backed up

### Reproducibility

Every analysis must be reproducible:

1. Document package dependencies (DESCRIPTION file or README)
2. Set seeds for random processes
3. Document software versions
4. Include instructions to rerun

## Publications

### Authorship

Follow [ICMJE guidelines](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html):

1. Substantial contributions to conception/design or data acquisition/analysis
2. Drafting or critically revising the manuscript
3. Final approval of the version to be published
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects

Discuss authorship early and revisit as contributions evolve.

### Writing Process

1. **Outline**: Share structure before writing
2. **Drafts**: Use tracked changes or Git branches
3. **Review**: At least one lab member reviews before submission
4. **Preprints**: Encouraged for most work (arXiv, bioRxiv)

### Code Availability

Published papers should include:

- GitHub repository with analysis code
- Data availability statement
- README with reproduction instructions

## Professional Development

### Conferences

- Present work at least once per year
- Submit abstracts early (discuss with Dr. Rashid)
- Share travel funding opportunities

### Training

- Complete required compliance training
- Attend relevant seminars and workshops
- Share useful resources with the lab

## Work-Life Balance

- Core hours: Generally 10am-4pm for meetings
- Remote work: Flexible, communicate availability
- Vacation: Take it! Just coordinate coverage
- Wellness: Your health comes first

## Getting Help

- **Technical issues**: `#computing` Teams channel
- **Research questions**: 1:1 or lab meeting
- **Administrative**: Department staff
- **Personal concerns**: Dr. Rashid (confidentially)
