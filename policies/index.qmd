## Communication

### Teams

Our primary communication tool. Key channels:

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#general` | Announcements, lab-wide discussions |
| `#computing` | Technical questions, Longleaf issues |
| `#papers` | Paper discussions, writing feedback |
| `#random` | Non-work chat |

**Response expectations:**

- Direct messages: Within 24 hours
- Channel mentions: Within 48 hours
- Urgent matters: Email or call

### Meetings

- **Lab meetings**: Weekly, attendance expected
- **1:1s with Dr. Rashid**: Bi-weekly or as scheduled
- **Working groups**: As needed for projects

## Detailed Meeting Guide
See the [Lab Meetings](meetings.qmd) page for comprehensive guidance on agendas, notes, action items, and the [Meeting Schedule](schedule.qmd) for the current rotation.

## 1:1 Meetings with Dr. Rashid

Bi-weekly individual meetings are for mentorship, progress review, and removing blockers.

**Before your 1:1:**

- Review your action items from the last meeting
- Prepare 2-3 bullet points on progress since last time
- Identify 1-2 specific questions or blockers to discuss
- Have your current work ready to show (code, figures, writing)

**Typical structure (30 min):**

1. **Your updates and questions** (15 min) - What you've done, what's blocking you
2. **Feedback and discussion** (10 min) - Dr. Rashid's input, suggestions, connections
3. **Action items** (5 min) - Clear next steps with owners and deadlines

**Tips:**

- Come prepared—don't wing it
- Be specific about blockers ("I'm stuck on X" not "things are hard")
- Take notes on action items during the meeting
- It's okay to say "I don't know" or "I need help with..."

## Code and Data

### Version Control

All code must be version controlled with Git:

- Public repos on GitHub when possible
- Private repos for unpublished work
- No code in email attachments

### Data Management

::: {.callout-important}
## Never Push Data to Git
Data files—especially large ones—should **never** be committed to repositories. Use the lab project directory for data storage and symlinks for access.
:::

#### Storage Principles

| Data Type | Location | Git Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Raw data** | `/proj/rashidlab/<project>/data/raw/` | Never commit |
| **Processed data** | `/proj/rashidlab/<project>/data/processed/` | Never commit |
| **Small configs** | `config/` in repo | Commit |
| **Results** | `results/` in repo | Usually gitignore |

#### Why Not in Repos?

1. **Size limits**: GitHub has a 100MB file limit; data often exceeds this
2. **History bloat**: Binary files in Git history cause repo bloat
3. **Sensitive data**: PHI and identifiable data must never be in public repos
4. **Collaboration**: Large files slow down `git clone` for collaborators

#### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Store data in lab project directory
cp dataset.csv /proj/rashidlab/my-project/data/raw/

# 2. Create symlink from your repo (optional, for convenience)
cd my-project
ln -s /proj/rashidlab/my-project/data data

# 3. Ensure data/ is in .gitignore
echo "data/" >> .gitignore
```

#### After Publication

When the paper is accepted:

1. **Public data**: Upload to appropriate repository (GEO, Zenodo, figshare)
2. **Update README**: Add data download instructions with URLs
3. **Include setup script**: `scripts/download_data.sh` to automate retrieval

Example setup script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/download_data.sh - Download data after cloning repo

mkdir -p data/raw

# Download from GEO
wget -O data/raw/expression.csv "https://geo.example.com/GSE12345/data.csv"

# Download from Zenodo
wget -O data/raw/clinical.csv "https://zenodo.org/record/12345/files/clinical.csv"

echo "Data download complete. Run 'make all' to reproduce results."
```

#### Gitignore Template

Your `.gitignore` should include:
```
# Data (never commit)
data/
*.csv
*.tsv
*.xlsx
*.rds
*.RData

# Large outputs
results/
_targets/

# Sensitive
*.pem
*.key
.env
```

#### Key Principles

- **Raw data**: Never modify, always preserve original
- **Processed data**: Document all transformations in code
- **Sensitive data**: Follow IRB protocols strictly
- **Backups**: Lab project directory (`/proj/rashidlab/`) is backed up

## Data Privacy & Security

Research data—especially clinical and genomic data—requires careful handling to protect patient privacy and comply with regulations.

### Classification Levels

| Level | Examples | Handling |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Public** | Published results, code | Can be shared openly |
| **Internal** | Unpublished analyses | Lab members only |
| **Confidential** | De-identified clinical data | IRB-approved users only |
| **Restricted (PHI)** | Identifiable patient data | Strict access controls |

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

::: {.callout-important}
## PHI Requires Special Handling
PHI includes any data that could identify a patient: names, dates, medical record numbers, genomic sequences linked to identifiers, images, etc.
:::

**Requirements for PHI:**

1. **IRB approval** before any access or analysis
2. **HIPAA training** completed annually (via UNC)
3. **Secure storage** only—never on personal devices or cloud storage
4. **Access logging**—document who accessed what and when
5. **De-identification** before any sharing or publication

### Secure Computing Practices

**Do:**

- Use UNC-approved systems (Longleaf) for sensitive data
- Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts
- Lock your workstation when stepping away
- Report any suspected breaches immediately

**Never:**

- Store PHI on personal laptops, Dropbox, Google Drive, or GitHub
- Share credentials or use shared accounts
- Email datasets containing identifiable information
- Leave printed materials with PHI unattended

### De-identification

Before sharing data (even internally), remove or transform:

- Direct identifiers (names, MRNs, SSNs)
- Dates more specific than year
- Geographic data smaller than state
- Any unique characteristics

```r
# Example: basic de-identification
deidentify <- function(data) {
  data$patient_id <- seq_len(nrow(data))  # Replace with sequential IDs
  data$mrn <- NULL                         # Remove MRN
  data$dob <- NULL                         # Remove birthdate
  data$age_group <- cut(data$age, breaks = c(0, 40, 60, 80, Inf),
                        labels = c("<40", "40-59", "60-79", "80+"))
  data$age <- NULL                         # Replace exact age with range
  return(data)
}
```

### Incident Response

If you suspect a data breach or security incident:

1. **Stop** any ongoing data transfer immediately
2. **Document** what happened (time, files involved, who was affected)
3. **Report** to Dr. Rashid and UNC ITS Security within 24 hours
4. **Do not** attempt to "fix" or hide the issue

### Training Requirements

| Training | Frequency | Link |
|----------|-----------|------|
| HIPAA Privacy | Annual | [UNC HIPAA Training](https://www.med.unc.edu/compliance/hipaa/) |
| CITI Human Subjects | Before research | [CITI Program](https://about.citiprogram.org/) |
| Responsible Conduct | Once | Graduate school requirement |
| Information Security | Annual | [UNC ITS Training](https://its.unc.edu/security/training/) |

### Reproducibility

Every analysis must be reproducible:

1. Document package dependencies (DESCRIPTION file or README)
2. Set seeds for random processes
3. Document software versions
4. Include instructions to rerun

## Publications

### Authorship

Follow [ICMJE guidelines](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html):

1. Substantial contributions to conception/design or data acquisition/analysis
2. Drafting or critically revising the manuscript
3. Final approval of the version to be published
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects

Discuss authorship early and revisit as contributions evolve.

### Writing Process

1. **Outline**: Share structure before writing
2. **Drafts**: Use tracked changes or Git branches
3. **Review**: At least one lab member reviews before submission
4. **Preprints**: Encouraged for most work (arXiv, bioRxiv)

### Code Availability

Published papers should include:

- GitHub repository with analysis code
- Data availability statement
- README with reproduction instructions

## Professional Development

### Conferences

- Present work at least once per year
- Submit abstracts early (discuss with Dr. Rashid)
- Share travel funding opportunities

### Training

- Complete required compliance training
- Attend relevant seminars and workshops
- Share useful resources with the lab

## Work-Life Balance

- Core hours: Generally 10am-4pm for meetings
- Remote work: Flexible, communicate availability
- Vacation: Take it! Just coordinate coverage
- Wellness: Your health comes first

## Getting Help

- **Technical issues**: `#computing` Teams channel
- **Research questions**: 1:1 or lab meeting
- **Administrative**: Department staff
- **Personal concerns**: Dr. Rashid (confidentially)
