## Overview

The lab uses YAML-based configuration files in the `rashidlab/lab-admin` repository to track student profiles, project assignments, PhD milestones, and meeting frequency. A weekly digest generated from these configs helps the PI monitor progress across the lab.

As a student, you are responsible for keeping your own profile up to date. This page explains what is tracked, where the files live, and how to make updates.

## Your Profile (`students.yml`)

Your profile lives in `config/students.yml` inside the `rashidlab/lab-admin` repository. To update it:

1. Clone or navigate to `rashidlab/lab-admin`.
2. Open `config/students.yml` and find your entry.
3. Make your edits, then open a PR or ask the PI to merge the change directly.

### Required fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `research_focus` | One-sentence description of your current research area. |
| `expected_graduation` | Target graduation semester, e.g., `"Spring 2029"`. |
| `meeting_preferences` | Contains `preferred_day`, `preferred_time`, and `frequency` (`weekly` or `biweekly`). |
| `funding` | Contains `source` (`RA`, `TA`, or `fellowship`), `grant_name`, and `end_date`. |
| `committee` | Contains `members` (list of names) and `external_member`. |
| `milestones` | Target dates for PhD milestones as they become known, formatted as `"YYYY-MM"`. |

      status: "upcoming"
```

::: {.callout-tip}
You do not need to fill in every milestone date immediately. Add target dates as they become known, and update statuses as you progress.
:::

## Projects (`projects.yml`)

Each project tracked by the lab has an entry in `config/projects.yml`. Projects are typed by category: `package`, `paper`, `grant`, `teaching`, or `infrastructure`.

Students are assigned to projects via the `students` field in each project entry. Your assigned projects will appear in the weekly digest and in the 1:1 prep reports the PI uses before meetings.

To update a project's status or `next_action`, edit `config/projects.yml` and open a PR. This keeps the PI and other collaborators aware of where things stand without needing a separate conversation.

## Milestones

The system tracks six PhD milestones:

1. **Core Coursework** -- completion of required courses.
2. **Written Prelim** -- the written preliminary examination.
3. **Oral Prelim** -- the oral preliminary examination.
4. **Dissertation Proposal** -- formal proposal defense.
5. **First Paper** -- first first-author manuscript submitted.
6. **Defense** -- dissertation defense.

### How milestone tracking works

- Set target dates in `students.yml` as they become known (format: `"YYYY-MM"`).
- Update the status field as you progress: `upcoming` -> `in_progress` -> `complete`.
- The system alerts the PI when a deadline is within 14 days or is overdue.
- A Gantt chart of your milestone timeline is generated monthly and stored at `milestones/gantt/<your-name>.pdf`.

::: {.callout-note}
Milestone dates are targets, not hard deadlines. The alerts exist so the PI can proactively check in, not to penalize you. Update the dates if your timeline shifts.

## 1:1 Meetings

After each 1:1 meeting with the PI, create a notes file at:

```
1on1-meetings/<your-name>/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Use the template at `1on1-meetings/templates/notes-template.md` as your starting point. The template includes these sections:

- **Progress Since Last Meeting** -- what you accomplished.
- **Current Focus** -- what you are working on now.
- **Questions for PI** -- anything you want to discuss.
- **Action Items** -- concrete next steps with owners.

The system tracks meeting frequency based on the `frequency` field in your profile and flags meetings that are overdue. Before each 1:1, an automated prep report may be generated at:

```
1on1-meetings/<your-name>/prep-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

This report pulls together your recent commits, project statuses, and upcoming milestones so the PI can come to the meeting prepared.

## GitHub Issues

The PI or automated checks may create GitHub Issues in `rashidlab/lab-admin` assigned to you. Issues with an `auto:` label prefix are system-generated and correspond to specific conditions:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `auto:onboarding` | Profile setup checklist (created for new students). |
| `auto:milestone` | A milestone deadline is approaching or overdue. |
| `auto:activity` | No commits detected in any of your assigned repositories for 2+ weeks. |
| `auto:followup` | A previously created issue has gone stale (>30 days without update). |
| `auto:meeting` | Your 1:1 meeting is overdue based on your configured frequency. |

Close the issue when the underlying condition is resolved or the task is complete. If an auto-generated issue is not relevant, leave a comment explaining why and close it.

## Quick Reference

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| Update my profile | Edit `config/students.yml`, open PR |
| Update project status | Edit `config/projects.yml`, open PR |
| Record a 1:1 meeting | Create `1on1-meetings/<name>/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Check my Gantt chart | See `milestones/gantt/<name>.pdf` |
| See the weekly digest | Ask the PI (PI-only for now) |
