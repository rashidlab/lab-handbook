  F31 LAB MEETING PRESENTATION TEMPLATE — Rashid Lab
========================================================================

  PURPOSE:
  This template is for new lab members to present their research to the
  lab for the first time. The sections mirror the NIH F31 (Ruth L.
  Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual NRSA) fellowship application to
  help you organize your thinking early in your PhD.

  UPDATED for FORMS-I (effective January 25, 2025). Section names and
  structure reflect the revised fellowship application and review criteria.

  HOW TO USE:
  1. Copy this file into your project directory
  2. Copy custom.css and the RLlogoA.png logo into the same directory
     (available from lab-handbook/assets/branding/)
  3. Replace placeholder text with your content
  4. Read the speaker notes (press S in presentation mode) for F31 tips
  5. Render with: quarto preview f31-lab-meeting-template.qmd

## About Me {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

### Background

- **Program:** [PhD in Biostatistics / your program]
- **Year:** [1st year, 2nd year, etc.]
- **Prior training:** [Undergrad institution, degree, relevant experience]

### Research Interests

- [Interest area 1]
- [Interest area 2]
- [Interest area 3]

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

### Path to the Rashid Lab

[1-2 sentences on what brought you to biostatistics and to this lab specifically. What excites you about the lab's research?]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Candidate's Goals, Preparedness, and Potential** (3 pages)

As of FORMS-I (Jan 2025), this section was renamed from "Applicant's Background
and Goals for Fellowship Training." It now requires four distinct personal
statements:

  1. Professional and fellowship goals
  2. Fellowship qualifications
  3. Self-assessment of strengths and areas for growth
  4. Scientific perspective — your unique viewpoint on the research problem

For this lab talk, focus on introducing yourself and setting the stage for
*why* you're the right person to tackle this problem.

Think about: What skills from your prior training are relevant? What gaps in
your training does this PhD fill? What's your unique scientific lens?

  - Full instructions (FORMS-I PDF): https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-i/fellowship-forms-i.pdf

NOTE: Under the revised review criteria, grades are no longer required or
allowed in the candidate biosketch. The emphasis has shifted toward
evaluating your *potential* and *scientific perspective* rather than
academic metrics.

## The Problem {.smaller}

### [Disease / Statistical Challenge / Scientific Question]

[2-3 sentences framing the broad problem area. Why should anyone care?]

### The Burden

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- [Key statistic about disease burden, prevalence, or impact]
- [Current standard of care or existing methods]
- [Limitation of current approaches]

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

<!-- Replace with a relevant figure, diagram, or key data visualization -->
<!-- ![](figures/problem-overview.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"} -->

*[Placeholder: Add a figure illustrating the problem scope]*

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Significance (within Research Training Project Strategy)** (6 pages total for Significance + Innovation + Approach)

The Research Training Project Strategy section was renamed from "Research
Strategy" in FORMS-I. The Significance subsection answers: "Does this study
address an important problem?"

You need to explain the scientific premise — what's known, what current methods
exist, and how they fall short. Reviewers want to see that you understand the
landscape.

Key questions to answer:
  - What is the clinical/scientific impact if the problem remains unsolved?
  - What existing methods or knowledge does your work build on?
  - Who benefits from solving this problem?

## What's Missing {.smaller}

### Gaps in Current Knowledge

::: {.callout-note}
**Central Gap:** [One sentence stating the critical knowledge gap or methodological
limitation your research addresses]
:::

1. **Gap 1:** [Description of first gap in the literature or methodology]

2. **Gap 2:** [Description of second gap]

3. **Gap 3:** [Description of third gap, if applicable]

### Why These Gaps Matter

[1-2 sentences connecting the gaps back to patient outcomes, scientific understanding,
or methodological needs]

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Significance (continued)**

This is the "so what?" slide. Strong F31 applications create a clear narrative:
"Here is the problem → here is what we know → here is what we DON'T know →
and here is why that gap is consequential."

The gaps you identify here should lead directly to your Specific Aims on the
next slide. Each aim should address one or more of these gaps.

Tip: Reviewers look for gaps that are *tractable* — not just important, but
solvable within a PhD timeline with available data and methods.

## Specific Aims {.smaller}

### Long-term Goal

[One sentence: your broad career-level research goal]

### Overall Objective

[One sentence: what this specific project will accomplish]

### Central Hypothesis

[One sentence: the testable hypothesis driving your work]

---

**Aim 1:** [Aim title — action verb + what you will do]

> [One sentence rationale and expected outcome]

**Aim 2:** [Aim title — action verb + what you will do]

> [One sentence rationale and expected outcome]

**Aim 3 (if applicable):** [Aim title — action verb + what you will do]

> [One sentence rationale and expected outcome]

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Research Training Project Specific Aims** (1 page)

Renamed from "Specific Aims" in FORMS-I to emphasize the training context.
This is still the single most important page of an F31 — it must stand alone.
Reviewers read it first and form their initial impression here.

Structure (classic format):
  1. Opening paragraph: problem + significance (2-3 sentences)
  2. "What is known" paragraph: current state of knowledge
  3. "What is NOT known" paragraph: the gap (leads to your hypothesis)
  4. Overall objective + central hypothesis
  5. Aims (2-3, usually)
  6. Impact statement: how the field changes if aims are achieved

Tips:
  - Each aim should be *independently achievable* — if Aim 1 fails, Aim 2
    should still be feasible
  - Aims should be related but not dependent on each other's outcomes
  - Use strong action verbs: Develop, Evaluate, Characterize, Determine
  - For biostatistics, aims often follow a pattern: (1) develop method,
    (2) evaluate via simulation, (3) apply to real data

## Aim 1: [Short Title] {.smaller}

### Rationale

[Why is this aim necessary? What gap does it address?]

### Approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Data**

- [Data source(s)]
- [Sample size / key characteristics]
- [How data will be obtained]

**Methods**

- [Statistical method or model]
- [Key assumptions]
- [Software / implementation]

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Expected Outcomes**

- [Primary expected result]
- [Secondary expected result]

**Potential Problems & Alternatives**

- [What could go wrong?]
- [Backup plan or alternative approach]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Approach (within Research Training Project Strategy)** (6 pages shared with Significance and Innovation)

The Approach subsection is where reviewers evaluate whether your plan is
feasible and rigorous. For each aim, address:
  - Rationale: Why this aim? How does it connect to the overall objective?
  - Design: What's the study design, data source, and analytical approach?
  - Expected outcomes: What do you expect to find?
  - Potential problems: What might go wrong, and what's your backup?

The "potential problems and alternative approaches" subsection is critical.
It shows maturity and planning — reviewers worry about trainees who haven't
considered failure modes.

For biostatistics students: clearly describe the statistical methodology and
how it improves on existing approaches. Include enough mathematical detail
that a quantitative reviewer can assess rigor.

## Aim 2: [Short Title] {.smaller}

### Rationale

[Why is this aim necessary? What gap does it address?]

### Approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Data**

- [Data source(s)]
- [Sample size / key characteristics]
- [How data will be obtained]

**Methods**

- [Statistical method or model]
- [Key assumptions]
- [Software / implementation]

:::

- [Secondary expected result]

**Potential Problems & Alternatives**

- [What could go wrong?]
- [Backup plan or alternative approach]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Approach (continued)**

Same structure as Aim 1. Make sure to articulate how this aim complements
Aim 1 without being dependent on it. If your aims use a shared data source,
describe it in full under Aim 1 and reference it briefly here.

Think about: Does each aim result in a distinct, publishable contribution?
Strong F31 applications often map aims to dissertation chapters / papers.

UNCOMMENT THIS SLIDE IF YOU HAVE A THIRD AIM:

## Aim 3: [Short Title] {.smaller}

### Rationale

[Why is this aim necessary? What gap does it address?]

### Approach

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Data / Methods**

- [Data source(s) and methods]

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Expected Outcomes / Alternatives**

- [Expected results and backup plans]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
F31 Section → Approach (continued). Same principles apply. For
biostatistics PhDs, 2-3 aims is typical. Don't feel obligated to have
3 aims — 2 strong aims is better than 3 weak ones.

## What's New About This Work {.smaller}

### Innovation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Methodological Innovation**

- [Novel statistical method, model, or algorithm]
- [New combination of existing approaches]
- [Improved computational approach]

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Applied Innovation**

- [New application domain for existing methods]
- [Novel data source or integration]
- [Clinical or translational impact]

:::

::::

::: {.callout-tip}
**How is this different from what exists?** [One sentence capturing the core
novelty of your approach compared to the status quo]
:::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Innovation (within Research Training Project Strategy)**

The Innovation subsection answers: "Does the project employ novel concepts,
approaches, or methodologies?"

NIH defines innovation along three axes:
  1. Novel theoretical concepts or frameworks
  2. Novel methodologies, tools, or technologies
  3. Novel applications of existing tools to new problems

You don't need to be novel on all three — but be specific about where your
contribution lies. Avoid vague claims like "no one has done this before."
Instead, explain *how* your approach shifts the current paradigm.

For biostatistics: methodological novelty is often your strongest card.
Clearly articulate what your method can do that existing methods cannot.

## Preliminary Data {.smaller}

### Current Progress

[Describe any preliminary work, pilot analyses, or initial results.
It's perfectly fine if this is minimal — you're early in your PhD!]

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

<!-- Replace with your preliminary figure or table -->
<!-- ![](figures/preliminary-result.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"} -->

*[Placeholder: preliminary figure or simulation result]*

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Key Observations**

- [What does the preliminary data suggest?]
- [How does it support your hypothesis or approach?]
- [What questions remain?]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Approach (Preliminary Studies, within Research Training Project Strategy)**

Preliminary data strengthens your application by demonstrating feasibility.
For new students, this might be:
  - A simulation study showing your method works in simple settings
  - Exploratory data analysis of your data source
  - A literature-based power analysis or sample size justification
  - Replication of a key result from a prior paper

Even a small pilot result is valuable. It shows reviewers you can execute
the work and that the project is tractable.

Don't worry if you have little to show yet — frame what you DO have as
evidence of feasibility and your capability.

**F31 Section → Training Activities and Timelines** (3 pages, NEW in FORMS-I)

This is a new standalone section in FORMS-I, separated from the old
"Applicant's Background" section. It now gets its own 3-page allocation,
signaling that NIH wants more detail on your training plan.

The F31 is a *training* grant — reviewers evaluate whether your proposed
training plan will prepare you for an independent research career. This
section should show self-awareness: what skills do you have, and what
gaps need filling?

Think about:
  - Short-term goals (during the PhD): what skills will this project teach you?
  - Long-term goals (career): where are you headed? (Academia, industry,
    government — all are valid)
  - How does *this specific project* serve your career trajectory?
  - What activities (courses, workshops, collaborations) will fill your gaps?

Concrete details matter: "Take BIOS 735 (Advanced Bayesian Methods)" is
stronger than "learn advanced statistics."

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Training Activities and Timelines (continued)**

The timeline demonstrates feasibility. Reviewers want to see that you've
thought through the order of operations and that the work is completable
within the fellowship period (typically 2-3 years of F31 support).

Tips:
  - Show some aim overlap — sequential aims can raise concerns about delays
  - Include milestones: qualifying exams, preliminary results, manuscripts
  - Be realistic — ambitious but achievable
  - F31 typically supports years 3-5 of a PhD in biostatistics
  - Under FORMS-I, the training timeline is now part of a dedicated section —
    reviewers expect a detailed mapping of activities to timepoints

- [Name — expertise area]

:::

::::

::: {.notes}
**F31 Section → Commitment to Candidate, Mentoring, and Training Environment**
(6 pages for sponsor statements + 2 pages for institutional environment description)

This entire section was renamed from "Sponsor(s), Collaborator(s), and
Consultant(s)" in FORMS-I. The new structure requires sponsors to provide
five required statements:

  1. Mentoring Approach and Candidate Mentoring Plan
  2. Prior Commitment to Training and Mentoring
  3. Commitment to the Candidate's Research Training Plan
  4. Research Training Environment
  5. Candidate's Potential

The renaming signals a shift: reviewers are now explicitly told to evaluate
the *quality of the mentoring plan* rather than being influenced by the
sponsor's or institution's reputation alone.

For your lab talk, this is a chance to articulate what you hope to gain
from the mentoring relationship and the department. Think about:
  - What specific expertise does your mentor bring?
  - What complementary expertise do co-mentors or committee members add?
  - What institutional resources (data, computing, collaborations) are available?

- [What feedback would be most helpful from the lab?]

::: {.notes}
This summary slide is not part of the F31 per se, but it mirrors the
"Impact" closing statement of the Specific Aims page. A strong closing
ties everything together: problem → gap → your approach → expected impact.

Use this slide to explicitly ask the lab for feedback. Good questions:
  - "Does the framing of the problem make sense to non-experts?"
  - "Are there methods I should consider for Aim 2?"
  - "Does anyone have experience with [data source / software]?"

Open the floor for discussion. Lab meetings are collaborative — encourage
questions about methodology, framing, data sources, and training goals.

Remember: the goal of this presentation is not to have everything figured
out. It's to organize your thinking and get early feedback from the lab.
