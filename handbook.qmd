## Getting Started

**For new lab members** - Start here to get set up and productive.

::: {.callout-tip}
## New to the lab?
Complete these in your first week: [First Week Checklist](onboarding/first-week.qmd)
:::

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Welcome & Overview](onboarding/index.qmd) | Lab orientation and key resources |
| [First Week](onboarding/first-week.qmd) | Day-by-day checklist for your first week |
| [Tools Setup](onboarding/tools-setup.qmd) | Install R, Git, configure Longleaf access |
| [GitHub Fundamentals](onboarding/github-fundamentals.qmd) | Issues, PRs, Discussions, Branches - explained simply |
| [First Project](onboarding/first-project.qmd) | Clone a template and run your first analysis |

## Lab Meetings & Policies

**How we communicate and collaborate** - Meeting workflows, communication norms, and lab policies.

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Lab Meetings](policies/meetings.qmd) | Complete guide to agendas, notes, action items, and leading meetings |
| [Meeting Schedule](policies/schedule.qmd) | Rotation, calendar, and who's presenting when |
| [Lab Policies](policies/index.qmd) | Communication, data management, publications, authorship |

**Key meeting info:**

- **When:** Thursdays 9:30-11:00am
- **Agenda deadline:** Wednesday 5pm
- **Where to find agendas:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/categories/lab-meetings)

---

## Coding Standards

**How we write code** - Style guides, version control, and reproducible pipelines.

Our code should be readable, reproducible, and maintainable. These guides establish lab conventions.

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [R Style Guide](coding-standards/r-style.qmd) | Base R + data.table conventions, naming, documentation |
| [Python Style Guide](coding-standards/python-style.qmd) | Python conventions for the rare Python project |
| [Git Practices](coding-standards/git-practices.qmd) | Commits, branches, Issues, Pull Requests, code review |
| [Targets Pipeline](coding-standards/targets-pipeline.qmd) | Reproducible workflows with `{targets}` and Slurm |

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Conventions
- **Data manipulation:** Base R + `data.table` (not tidyverse)
- **Dependencies:** DESCRIPTION file (not renv)
- **Version control:** Git + GitHub for everything
- **Reproducibility:** `{targets}` for computational pipelines
:::

## Project Templates

**How we structure projects** - Starter templates for common research workflows.

Don't start from scratch. Use these templates to ensure consistency and completeness.

| Template | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| [Research Project](templates/research-project.qmd) | General analysis project with data, code, and results |
| [Methods Paper](templates/methods-paper.qmd) | Methodology paper with simulations and Quarto manuscript |
| [R Package](templates/package-development.qmd) | Developing an R package for reuse |

Each template includes:
- Directory structure
- README template
- Essential files (DESCRIPTION, .gitignore, etc.)
- Instructions for getting started

---

## Project Consistency

**How we keep things in sync** - Ensuring code matches manuscripts.

When code changes, manuscripts can become inconsistent. This framework prevents that.

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Overview](project-consistency/index.qmd) | Why consistency matters and how the framework works |
| [Config Values](project-consistency/config-values.qmd) | Single source of truth for parameters |
| [Method Claims](project-consistency/method-claims.qmd) | Registry for claims that must match code output |
| [Data Provenance](project-consistency/data-provenance.qmd) | Track where data comes from |
| [Validation](project-consistency/validation.qmd) | Automated checks before submission |

---

## Branding & Presentations

**How we present our work** - Slides, colors, and visual identity.

| Guide | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Branding Overview](branding/index.qmd) | Lab visual identity guidelines |
| [Presentations](branding/presentations.qmd) | Quarto RevealJS slides with lab styling |
| [Color Palette](branding/colors.qmd) | UNC colors (Carolina Blue, Navy) |
| [Assets](branding/assets.qmd) | Logos and downloadable files |
| [CLAUDE.md Template](branding/claude-template.qmd) | AI assistant guidance template |

---

## Computing Resources

**How we use HPC** - Longleaf, Slurm, and computational environments.

Most production work runs on UNC's Longleaf cluster. This guide covers setup and usage.

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| [Computing Guide](computing/index.qmd) | Longleaf access, Slurm basics, job submission |
| [Tools Setup](onboarding/tools-setup.qmd) | Module system, VS Code Remote SSH |
| [Targets Pipeline](coding-standards/targets-pipeline.qmd) | Running `{targets}` with `crew.cluster` on Slurm |

::: {.callout-important}
## Production Work → Longleaf
Develop locally if you prefer, but run production analyses on Longleaf for reproducibility and collaboration.
