## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
## Use Longleaf for Production Work

**Longleaf (UNC's HPC cluster)** is the recommended environment for:

- Running simulations and calibrations
- Reproducible analyses
- Collaborative work (shared file system)
- Long-running jobs

Local machines are fine for writing code, small-scale testing, and manuscript writing.

## Choose Your Setup Path

| Path | Best For | Guide |
|------|----------|-------|
| **A: Longleaf-Primary** (Recommended) | Most lab work | [Longleaf Setup](setup-longleaf.qmd) |
| **B: Local + Longleaf** | Prefer local editing | [Local Setup](setup-local.qmd) + [Longleaf Setup](setup-longleaf.qmd) |
| **C: Local Only** | Small projects, testing | [Local Setup](setup-local.qmd) |

**All paths require Git:** [Git & GitHub Setup](setup-git.qmd)

## Setup Guides

### [Longleaf Setup](setup-longleaf.qmd)

UNC's HPC cluster. Covers:

- Request access
- Open OnDemand (web interface) - **easiest way to start**
- VS Code Remote SSH
- Direct SSH access
- Module system and environment configuration

### [Local Development](setup-local.qmd)

Your laptop/desktop. Covers:

- R and RStudio installation
- Essential packages
- Quarto for documents
- Platform-specific notes (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### [Git & GitHub](setup-git.qmd)

Version control. Covers:

- Git installation and configuration
- GitHub CLI
- SSH key setup
- Git with OnDemand/RStudio

## Quick Start Recommendation

**New to the lab?** Follow this path:

1. [Request Longleaf access](setup-longleaf.qmd#request-access) (do this Day 1—takes 1-2 days to approve)
2. [Set up Git locally](setup-git.qmd) while you wait
3. Once approved, use [OnDemand](setup-longleaf.qmd#ondemand) for RStudio

## Having Issues?

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.qmd) for common problems and solutions.

## Verification

After setup, you should be able to:

- [ ] Log into Longleaf (via OnDemand or SSH)
- [ ] Run R and load `data.table`
- [ ] Clone a GitHub repo
- [ ] Render a Quarto document

Detailed verification steps are at the end of each setup guide.
