Welcome to the Rashid Lab! This guide will help you get set up and productive in your first weeks.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}
**Start here:** Follow the [First Two Weeks Checklist](first-week.qmd) — it's the canonical onboarding path with clear priorities for each day.

## What to Do (In Order)

1. **Complete administrative tasks** — HR paperwork, building access, Onyen credentials
2. **Set up your computing environment** — See [Tools Setup](tools-setup.qmd) (request Longleaf access on Day 1)
3. **Join communication channels** — Teams workspace and GitHub org
4. **Meet with Dr. Rashid** — Project overview, reading list, and mentor assignment
5. **Learn GitHub basics** — See [GitHub Fundamentals](github-fundamentals.qmd)
6. **Read the coding standards** — [Coding Standards](../coding-standards/index.qmd) (especially "Why Base R + data.table?")
7. **Start your first project** — [Your First Project](first-project.qmd) walks you through it

The [First Two Weeks Checklist](first-week.qmd) has all of this with day-by-day detail and clear "must do" vs. stretch goal markings.

## Key Resources

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Lab Teams | Daily communication (invite sent by Dr. Rashid) |
| [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rashidlab) | All code repositories |
| [Lab Meeting Discussions](https://github.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/discussions/categories/lab-meetings) | Biweekly agendas & notes |
| [Meeting Schedule](../policies/schedule.qmd) | Rotation and calendar |
| [Longleaf Docs](https://help.rc.unc.edu/longleaf-cluster/) | UNC HPC cluster |

## What to Expect

Graduate students in the lab typically balance coursework and research. Here's a rough sketch of what a typical week looks like:

- **Research time** varies by year: during coursework semesters, expect ~10-15 hours/week on research, ramping up after comps
- **Lab meetings** are every two weeks (Thursdays 9:30am) — attendance is expected
- **1:1s with Dr. Rashid** are biweekly (30 min) — come prepared with updates and questions
- **Core hours** are roughly 10am-4pm for availability, but schedules are otherwise flexible
- **Remote work** is fine — just communicate your availability on Teams
- **Vacation** — take it! Coordinate with Dr. Rashid and let the team know

There's no expectation to have everything figured out in your first month. The first few weeks are about getting set up and oriented; productive research ramps up gradually.

## Questions?

| I need help with... | Where to go |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Code error or computing issue | `#computing` Teams channel |
| Research or project question | 1:1 meeting or lab meeting |
| Administrative / HR | Department staff |
| Something personal | Dr. Rashid (confidentially) |
