A checklist for your first two weeks in the lab. Don't worry about finishing everything on a strict schedule — the items marked **Must do** are the priority. Everything else is a stretch goal that can slide into the following week if needed.

## Week 1: Get Set Up

### Administrative (Day 1) — Must do

- [ ] Complete HR onboarding paperwork
- [ ] Get building/office access
- [ ] Obtain Onyen and UNC credentials
- [ ] Set up UNC email
- [ ] Get added to lab mailing list

### Computing Setup (Days 1-3) — Must do

- [ ] Request Longleaf cluster access (do this Day 1 — approval takes 1-2 business days)
- [ ] Install R (≥4.3) and RStudio locally
- [ ] Install Git and configure credentials
- [ ] Set up GitHub SSH keys ([Git & GitHub Setup](setup-git.qmd))
- [ ] Join lab GitHub organization

### Communication (Day 2) — Must do

- [ ] Join lab Teams workspace
- [ ] Subscribe to relevant channels:
  - `#general` - Announcements
  - `#computing` - Technical help
  - `#papers` - Literature discussion
  - `#random` - Social
- [ ] Add lab meeting to calendar (every two weeks, Thursday 9:30am)

### Orientation (Days 3-5) — Must do

- [ ] Meet with Dr. Rashid (1:1)
- [ ] Get overview of current lab projects
- [ ] Receive reading list (2-3 key papers)
- [ ] Identify project mentor
- [ ] Attend lab meeting (if it falls during your first week)

### Stretch goals for Week 1

- [ ] Install Quarto
- [ ] Log into Longleaf via OnDemand (once access is approved)
- [ ] Browse the [Coding Standards](../coding-standards/index.qmd)

### End of Week 1 Goals

By Friday, you should have:

- ✅ Computing access requested or approved
- ✅ Git and GitHub configured
- ✅ Joined Teams and the GitHub org
- ✅ Met with Dr. Rashid and received your reading list
- ✅ Know who to ask for different types of help

## Week 2: Start Working

### Computing (Days 6-7) — Must do

- [ ] Log into Longleaf and verify R works ([Longleaf Setup](setup-longleaf.qmd))
- [ ] Set up your `.bashrc` and `.Rprofile` on Longleaf

### First Code (Days 7-9) — Must do

- [ ] Clone a project template ([Your First Project](first-project.qmd))
- [ ] Install project dependencies (`install.packages(c("targets", "data.table", "here"))`)
- [ ] Run the example pipeline (`targets::tar_make()`)
- [ ] Make a small modification
- [ ] Commit and push

### Reading — Must do

1. [Coding Standards](../coding-standards/index.qmd) - Lab code style (especially the "Why Base R + data.table?" section)
2. [Your First Project](first-project.qmd) - Includes a "What is targets?" introduction

### Reading — When you're ready

3. [Targets Pipeline Guide](../coding-standards/targets-pipeline.qmd) - Full reference (skim for now, reference later)
4. [Project Consistency](../project-consistency/index.qmd) - Relevant when you start writing up results

### End of Week 2 Goals

By Friday, you should be able to:

- ✅ Log into Longleaf and run R
- ✅ Clone, modify, and push to a GitHub repo
- ✅ Run a `targets` pipeline
- ✅ Render a Quarto document to PDF
- ✅ Understand the basics of the lab's coding conventions

## Questions to Ask

In your first meeting with Dr. Rashid:

1. What project will I be working on?
2. Who is my day-to-day mentor?
3. What are the short-term and long-term goals?
4. What background reading should I prioritize?
5. When is my first presentation expected?
