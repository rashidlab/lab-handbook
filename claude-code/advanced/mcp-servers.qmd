MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers connect Claude to external tools, databases, and services.

## What Are MCP Servers?

MCP servers provide Claude with:
- Access to databases (PubMed, UniProt, etc.)
- Integration with lab systems
- Specialized scientific tools
- Data visualization capabilities

## Recommended Plugins

The lab recommends these plugins (which include MCP servers):

### scientific-skills

Scientific databases and analysis tools:

```bash
claude plugins install scientific-skills@claude-scientific-skills
```

Provides access to:
- **Databases**: PubMed, UniProt, KEGG, ChEMBL, ClinicalTrials.gov
- **Analysis**: Statistical methods, visualization
- **Data formats**: FASTA, PDB, CSV, Excel

### superpowers

Development workflow tools:

```bash
claude plugins install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

Provides:
- Code review agents
- TDD workflows
- Debugging tools
- Git worktree management

### github

GitHub CLI integration:

```bash
claude plugins install github@claude-plugins-official
```

Provides:
- Issue management
- Pull request workflows
- Repository operations

## Using MCP-Provided Tools

### Database Queries

With scientific-skills installed:

```
> Search PubMed for recent papers on TREM2 and Alzheimer's

> Get the protein sequence for human TP53 from UniProt

> What clinical trials are recruiting for glioblastoma?
```

### Data Analysis

```
> Perform a power analysis for a two-sample t-test

> Create a volcano plot from this differential expression data

> Run a survival analysis on the patient data
```

### File Operations

```
> Read the Excel file and summarize the data

> Convert this FASTA to a table format

> Parse the PDB file and extract chain A coordinates
```

## Configuration

MCP servers are configured through plugins. Check your configuration:

```bash
# List installed plugins
claude plugins list

# Check what tools are available
claude tools list
```

## Lab-Specific Integrations

### Accessing Lab Data

For projects that need lab-specific integrations:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "lab-data": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["scripts/lab_data_server.py"],
        "description": "Access to /proj/rashidlab/ data"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Scientific Tools

For specialized analysis:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "simulation-tools": {
        "command": "Rscript",
        "args": ["scripts/simulation_server.R"],
        "description": "Run simulations with lab parameters"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Skills from Plugins

### scientific-skills Database Tools

| Tool | Description |

| pubmed-database | Search PubMed literature |
| uniprot-database | Query protein sequences |
| pdb-database | Access protein structures |
| kegg-database | Query pathway data |
| chembl-database | Search compound data |
| clinicaltrials-database | Find clinical trials |

### scientific-skills Analysis Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| statistical-analysis | Statistical tests |
| exploratory-data-analysis | EDA workflows |
| scientific-visualization | Create figures |
| hypothesis-generation | Research planning |

### superpowers Development Tools

## Example Workflows

### Literature Search

```
> Search PubMed for papers on Bayesian adaptive trials
> published in the last 2 years

Claude uses pubmed-database to query and summarize results.
```

### Protein Analysis

```
> Get the TP53 sequence from UniProt and identify
> functional domains

Claude fetches data and analyzes the protein.
```

### Statistical Analysis

```
> Run a power analysis for detecting a 0.5 effect size
> with alpha=0.05

Claude uses statistical tools to compute power.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tool not found

```bash
# Reinstall the plugin
claude plugins uninstall scientific-skills@claude-scientific-skills
claude plugins install scientific-skills@claude-scientific-skills
```

### Server connection failed

```bash
# Check plugin status
claude plugins list

# Check for updates
claude plugins update
```

### Tool runs slowly

Large database queries may take time. For complex queries, consider:
- Breaking into smaller queries
- Using more specific search terms
- Caching results locally

## Security Notes

- MCP servers can access external resources
- Be cautious with sensitive data
- Lab data should stay on approved systems
- Don't expose credentials in MCP configurations
