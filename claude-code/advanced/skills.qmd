Skills are reusable command templates that you invoke with `/skillname`. They encode complex workflows into simple commands.

## What Are Skills?

A skill is a markdown file in `.claude/commands/` that defines:
- What the command does
- Step-by-step instructions for Claude
- Any parameters it accepts

## Using Skills

```
> /review              # Run the review skill
> /review --all        # With arguments
> /validate            # Run validation skill
```

## Lab-Provided Skills

### /review

Comprehensive code review with priority-ordered checks:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/review.md

# /review - Code Review Command

Review changes for bugs, security issues, and lab standard violations.

## Usage
/review              # Review since last commit
/review --all        # Review all recent changes

## Instructions

When invoked:

1. Check git status for changed files
2. Review each file with this priority:
   - Logic errors (highest priority)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data integrity issues
   - Lab standard violations
   - Style issues (lowest priority)

3. Check project-specific patterns from review-checklist.yml

4. Output findings as:
   - CRITICAL: Must fix
   - WARNING: Should review
   - INFO: Minor notes

5. Write summary to logs/code_review.log
```

### /validate

Check project consistency:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/validate.md

# /validate - Project Consistency Check

Verify project follows the consistency framework.

## Instructions

1. Check globals.yml exists and is valid YAML
2. Scan R/ for hardcoded values that should be in globals.yml
3. Verify manuscript uses dynamic values (not hardcoded)
4. Check DATA_PROVENANCE.md is up to date
5. Report any inconsistencies found
```

### /preflight

Pre-Slurm submission checks:

```markdown
# .claude/commands/preflight.md

# /preflight - Pre-Submission Checks

Run before submitting jobs to Slurm.

## Instructions

1. Check for stale lock files in _targets/
2. Look for orphaned worker processes
3. Verify Slurm script has required directives
4. Check disk space in /proj/rashidlab/
5. Confirm R packages are available
6. Report any issues that would cause job failure
```

## Creating Custom Skills

### 1. Create the file

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
nano .claude/commands/myskill.md
```

### 2. Write the skill

```markdown
# /myskill - Description

Brief description of what this skill does.

## Usage

/myskill [arguments]

## Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for Claude:

1. First, do X
2. Then, check Y
3. Finally, output Z

## Examples

Example invocation and expected output.
```

### 3. Use it

```
> /myskill
```

## Skill Structure

### Basic Template

```markdown
# /skillname - Short Description

Longer description of purpose.

## Usage

/skillname [optional-args]

## Instructions

When this command is invoked:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Output Format

Describe expected output format.
```

### With Parameters

```markdown
# /analyze - Run Analysis

## Usage

/analyze <target>           # Analyze specific target
/analyze --all              # Analyze everything
/analyze --since <date>     # Since specific date

## Instructions

Parse the arguments:
- If <target> provided: analyze that target
- If --all: analyze all targets
- If --since: filter by date

Then proceed with analysis...
```

## Best Practices

### Keep Skills Focused

Each skill should do one thing well:

```markdown
# Good: Focused
/review    # Review code
/validate  # Check consistency
/preflight # Pre-submission checks

# Bad: Too broad
/do-everything  # Review, validate, and submit
```

### Include Examples

```markdown
## Examples

### Example 1: Basic usage
> /review
Reviews changes since last commit...

### Example 2: With arguments
> /review --since abc123
Reviews all changes since commit abc123...
```

### Reference Project Files

```markdown
## Instructions

1. Read the review checklist from `.claude/review-checklist.yml`
2. Apply patterns specific to this project
3. Check critical files listed in CLAUDE.md
```

## Skill vs Agent

| Feature | Skill (/command) | Agent |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Invocation | `/skillname` | "Use the reviewer agent" |
| Purpose | Workflow automation | Specialized expertise |
| Length | Short, procedural | Can be detailed |
| State | Stateless | Can maintain context |

Use skills for workflows; use agents for specialized knowledge.

## Sharing Skills

### Within the Lab

Skills in template repos are shared with everyone:

```
template-research-project/.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── review.md
    └── validate.md
```

### Personal Skills

Add to `~/.claude/commands/` for personal skills available everywhere.
