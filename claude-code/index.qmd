## Why Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered command-line tool that helps you write, understand, and debug code directly in your terminal. For Rashid Lab members, it offers:

| Benefit | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Accelerate research** | Write code faster, debug quicker, automate repetitive tasks |
| **Improve quality** | Built-in code review, catches common errors, enforces lab standards |
| **Learning tool** | Ask Claude to explain code, methods, or statistical concepts |
| **Integration** | Works with our existing git, targets, and HPC workflows |

## Lab Team Account
Rashid Lab has a Claude for Teams subscription. Contact Dr. Rashid to be added to the team account, which provides:

- Shared usage across lab projects
- No individual billing
- Access to latest Claude models

## Where to Start
Most lab members only need the first three pages below: **Installation**, **First Session**, and **Daily Workflow**. The remaining pages are references you can consult as needed — you don't need to read everything up front.

| **Cheatsheet** | [Reference](reference.qmd) | — | Quick command reference |

## How It Works

Claude Code runs in your terminal alongside your normal development workflow:

```bash
# Start Claude Code in any project directory
claude

# Claude sees your project files, git history, and CLAUDE.md instructions
# You chat naturally to explore, modify, and run code
```

Claude can:

- **Read and understand** your entire codebase
- **Write and edit** files directly
- **Run commands** (git, Rscript, make, sbatch)
- **Explain code** and help you learn
- **Review changes** before committing

## Lab-Specific Configuration

Every project in the lab uses a `CLAUDE.md` file that tells Claude about:

- Project structure and purpose
- Lab coding standards (base R + data.table, not tidyverse)
- Common commands and workflows
- Configuration files and their roles

This means Claude automatically follows lab conventions without you having to remind it.

## Getting Started

Ready to start? Head to the [Installation](installation.qmd) guide to set up Claude Code on your machine and Longleaf.

Already installed? Try the [First Session](first-session.qmd) walkthrough for a hands-on introduction.
