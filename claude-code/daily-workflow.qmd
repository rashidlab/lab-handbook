This guide covers the patterns and habits that make Claude Code most effective for daily research work.

## Starting Your Day

### 1. Open your project

```bash
cd ~/rashid-lab-setup/my-project
claude
```

### 2. Get oriented

```
> What's the current state of this project? Check git status
> and any recent changes.
```

Claude checks:
- Git status (uncommitted changes, current branch)
- Recent commits
- Pipeline status (if using targets)

### 3. Review your plan

```
> Read docs/plans/ and summarize what I should work on today
```

## Core Pattern: Explore → Understand → Modify

The most effective pattern for working with Claude:

### Step 1: Explore

```
> What functions are in R/models.R?
> Show me the data processing pipeline
> How does the simulation work?
```

### Step 2: Understand

```
> Explain the fit_model() function in detail
> What are the inputs and outputs of the clean_data target?
> Why are we using this specific prior?
```

### Step 3: Modify

```
> Add a parameter to fit_model() for the learning rate
> Update the simulation to include a new scenario
> Fix the bug in calculate_statistics()
```

## Avoid the "Just Do It" Trap
Asking Claude to "just make it work" without understanding the code leads to:
- Harder debugging when things break
- Less learning
- Potential violations of lab standards

Take time to understand what you're changing.

## Task-Specific Workflows

### Bug Fixing

```
> I'm getting this error: [paste error message]
> Help me understand and fix it
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze the error message
2. Find the relevant code
3. Explain the cause
4. Suggest a fix

### Adding Features

```
> I need to add bootstrap confidence intervals to the analysis.
> What files would need to change?
```

Claude maps out the changes before making them, letting you validate the approach.

### Refactoring

```
> This function is getting too long. Can you suggest how to
> break it into smaller functions?
```

### Writing Tests

```
> Help me write tests for the validate_input() function
```

### Documentation

```
> Add roxygen documentation to all functions in R/utils.R
```

## Managing Context

Claude has a context window that can fill up during long sessions.

### Keep sessions focused

One task per session works better than marathon sessions covering many topics.

### Use explicit file references

```
# Less effective (Claude searches everything)
> Update the model function

# More effective (Claude goes directly there)
> Update the fit_bayesian_model function in R/models.R
```

### Start fresh when stuck

If Claude seems confused or is giving inconsistent answers:

```bash
# Exit and restart
> /exit
claude
```

## Consistency Files

The lab uses several files to maintain project consistency. Claude reads these automatically.

### docs/plans/*.md

Design documents and implementation plans:

```
> Read docs/plans/2026-01-15-simulation-design.md and help me
> implement the next phase
```

### config/globals.yml

Single source of truth for project constants:

```yaml
# config/globals.yml
simulation:
  n_iterations: 1000
  seed: 42

model:
  prior_mean: 0
  prior_sd: 1
```

Tell Claude to use these values:

```
> Use the n_iterations value from globals.yml for the simulation
```

### CHANGELOG.md

Track what's changed:

```
> Add an entry to CHANGELOG.md summarizing today's changes
```

### docs/DATA_PROVENANCE.md

Document where data came from:

```
> Update DATA_PROVENANCE.md with the new dataset I added
```

See the [Project Consistency Framework](../project-consistency/index.qmd) for the full documentation.

## End of Day Checklist

Before ending your session:

### 1. Commit your work

```
> /commit
```

### 2. Update documentation

```
> Have I changed anything that should be documented?
```

### 3. Note tomorrow's tasks

```
> What should I work on next? Add a note to docs/plans/
```

### 4. Push to remote

```
> Push to origin
```

## Common Prompts

| Task | Prompt |
|------|--------|
| Check status | "What's the git status and pipeline status?" |
| Run pipeline | "Run tar_make()" |
| Review changes | "/review" |
| Commit | "/commit" |
| Explain code | "Explain how [function] works" |
| Debug error | "I'm getting this error: [paste]" |
| Add feature | "I need to add [feature]. What files need to change?" |
| Clean up | "Are there any unused functions in R/?" |

## Efficiency Tips

### Use skills

Skills are pre-defined workflows for common tasks:

```
> /review    # Code review
> /commit    # Commit workflow
> /validate  # Check project consistency
```

### Batch similar tasks

```
> Add roxygen documentation to all functions in R/utils.R,
> R/models.R, and R/simulation.R
```

### Let Claude suggest next steps

```
> What should I do next to finish this feature?
```

### Use templates

When starting a new analysis or function:

```
> Create a new function following the pattern in analyze_data()
```

## What Not to Do

| Avoid | Instead |
|-------|---------|
| "Just make it work" | Understand the problem first |
| Huge multi-hour sessions | Focused 30-60 minute sessions |
| Committing without review | Always run `/review` first |
| Ignoring lab standards | Reference globals.yml, follow style guide |
| Skipping documentation | Update docs as you go |
