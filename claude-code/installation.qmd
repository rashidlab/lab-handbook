## Local Installation

### 1. Install Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
claude login
```

This opens your browser for authentication. Use your UNC email if you've been added to the lab team account.

### 3. Set Up Lab Configuration

Copy the lab's global CLAUDE.md to your home directory:

```bash
# Create the .claude directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude

# Copy the student template (or pi template if you're Dr. Rashid)
cp ~/rashid-lab-setup/lab-handbook/config/claude/student-CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

This global file ensures Claude always knows about lab standards, regardless of which project you're in.

### 4. Install Recommended Plugins

```bash
# Enable GitHub integration
claude plugins install github@claude-plugins-official

# Enable commit workflow
claude plugins install commit-commands@claude-plugins-official

# Enable superpowers (code review, debugging, TDD)
claude plugins install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace

# Enable scientific skills (databases, visualization)
claude plugins install scientific-skills@claude-scientific-skills
```

### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version
claude --version

# Start Claude in any project
cd ~/rashid-lab-setup/lab-handbook
claude

# Try a simple command
> What files are in this project?
```

## Longleaf Installation

### 1. Connect to Longleaf

```bash
ssh <onyen>@longleaf.unc.edu
```

### 2. Install Claude Code

```bash
# Install in your home directory
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh

# Add to PATH (add this to your ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
# This will give you a URL to open in your local browser
claude login
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## SSH Tip
If you're using VS Code Remote-SSH, the browser authentication should work automatically. Otherwise, copy the URL and paste it in your local browser.
:::

### 4. Set Up Lab Configuration

```bash
# Create .claude directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude

# Option A: If you have rashid-lab-setup cloned on Longleaf
cp ~/rashid-lab-setup/lab-handbook/config/claude/student-CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Option B: Download directly from GitHub
curl -o ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rashidlab/lab-handbook/main/config/claude/student-CLAUDE.md
```

### 5. Configure for HPC Environment

Add these settings to handle Longleaf's environment:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
export CLAUDE_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1  # Optional: disable telemetry on shared systems
```

### 6. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Claude is accessible
claude --version

# Test in a project directory
cd ~/your-project
claude

# Verify lab config is loaded
> What are the lab coding standards?
```

## tmux for Long Sessions

On Longleaf, use tmux to keep Claude running even if you disconnect:

```bash
# Start a new tmux session
tmux new -s claude-work

# Start Claude
claude

# Detach with Ctrl-b, then d

# Reattach later
tmux attach -t claude-work
```

See the [HPC Usage](hpc-usage.qmd) guide for more on using Claude with Slurm jobs.

## Plugin Details

| Plugin | Purpose | Key Features |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **github** | GitHub CLI integration | View/create issues, PRs, discussions |
| **commit-commands** | Streamlined commits | `/commit` skill with lab conventions |
| **superpowers** | Development workflows | Code review, TDD, debugging, brainstorming |
| **scientific-skills** | Research tools | Database queries, visualization, analysis |

## Troubleshooting Installation

### "claude: command not found"

```bash
# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Make permanent (add to ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Authentication issues

```bash
# Clear and re-authenticate
claude logout
claude login
```

### Plugin installation fails

```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://claude.ai

# On Longleaf, ensure you're on a login node (not a compute node)
hostname  # Should show something like login*.longleaf.unc.edu
```

### Global CLAUDE.md not loading

```bash
# Verify file exists
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Check permissions
ls -la ~/.claude/
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to the [First Session](first-session.qmd) guide for a hands-on walkthrough of using Claude Code with a real project.
